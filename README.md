masking senstive data with azure vision ai
Masking sensitive data is a technique to protect personal or confidential information from unauthorized access or exposure. Azure Vision AI offers a feature called PII Detection, which can identify, categorize, and redact sensitive information in unstructured text and images. For example, it can mask phone numbers, email addresses, and forms of identification. You can use PII Detection to comply with privacy regulations, enhance data security, and prevent data leakage. To use PII Detection, you need to create an Azure AI Language resource and send a request containing your data to the API. You can also customize the masking mode, masking character, and domain of the entities to be detected. For more information, you can visit the PII Detection cognitive skill page or the What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection in Azure AI Language? article.
